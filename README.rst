Python bindings for the Bilean API
==================================

This is a client library for Bilean built on the Bilean billing API. It
provides a Python API (The ``bileanclient`` module) and a command-line tool
(``bilean``).

Development takes place via the usual OpenStack processes as outlined in the
`developer guide <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html>`_.
The master repository is in `Git <http://github.com/lvdongbing/python-bileanclient>`_.
